    <ul>
        <li>½ to 1 tablespoon (7-15 ml) soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup (120ml) canola oil (or vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>½ to 1 tablespoon (7-15 ml) oyster sauce</li>
        <li>½ small onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon (5g) chicken bouillon powder</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons (30-45ml) water or chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup (135g) of peas and carrots</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten lightly</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon (0.5-1g)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly with water, straining it twice. Combine the rice in a saucepan with <br>
            water,coconut milk, and salt. Place the saucepan over high heat and bring the mixture  to a <br>
            boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, stir the rice, reduce the heat to a low simmer, and cover the saucepan securely<br>
             with a lid. Allow it to cook for 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>After cooking, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit covered to cool. Once cooled, <br>
            fluff the rice with a fork. This step can be done a day in advance.</li>
        <li>Before proceeding, break apart any clumps of rice.</li>
        <li>In a large wok or skillet, heat approximately one tablespoon of canola or vegetable oil over<br>
             medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the rice to the wok and stir vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes. Then, incorporate soy sauce, <br>
            oyster sauce, and a tablespoon or more of water or stock as necessary to moisten the rice. <br>
            Set the rice aside and quickly wipe the wok or skillet with a clean paper towel or cloth.</li>
        <li>Next, heat another tablespoon of oil in the wok, add the eggs, and swiftly stir to break the <br>
            yolks and lightly scramble them. Remove the scrambled eggs and add them to the rice.</li>
        <li>Continue stir-frying by adding another tablespoon of oil to the wok, followed by onions, peas,<br>
             carrots, minced garlic, curry powder, and chicken bouillon powder. Stir the mixture until it <br>
             becomes fragrant, which should take about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, return the rice and scrambled eggs to the wok, stirring until everything is well combined.<br>
            Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped scallions and serve.</li>
  
    </ol>
