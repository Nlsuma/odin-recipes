    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Whatever the mood, a bowl of spicy tasty chicken and rice soup has always breath in me, <br>
        a unique sense of such indescribable satisfaction.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons (28ml) of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound (453.5g) of skinless, boneless chicken thighs, diced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, diced (approximately 1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 stalk of celery, sliced into ½-inch pieces (around ¾ cup)</li>
        <li>1-2 teaspoons (2-4g) of bouillon powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (4g) of [missing ingredient]</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (2g) of [missing ingredient]</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (2g) of fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (8g) of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup (185g) of uncooked long grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, diced (approximately 1½ cups)</li>
        <li>7-8 cups (1.5-1.9l) of chicken stock (or water), adjusted to achieve the preferred soup thickness</li>
        <li>Parsley, for garnish</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Begin by placing the chicken pieces in a large bowl, seasoning them with salt and black pepper,<br>
             and setting them aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add the chicken pieces and brown them for several minutes <br>
            until they achieve a golden color.</li>
        <li>Subsequently, incorporate the chopped onion, garlic, celery, thyme, bouillon powder, and bay leaf<br>
             into the pot. Cook and stir the mixture for approximately six minutes, allowing the vegetables to<br>
              soften without browning.</li>
        <li>Next, add the chicken broth or water and bring the mixture to a boil. Introduce the rice and <br>
            carrots, seasoning with additional salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer until the rice is tender, which should take about 20 <br>
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, garnish with parsley and serve while warm.</li>
    </ol>
