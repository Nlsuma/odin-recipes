    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ero is by large one of the most delectable cuisines in Africa, widely celebrated for its irresistible taste and <br>enticing aroma, which fills the senses with the warmth of freshly baked spices.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li> 4-5 pounds of meat or beef, tripe, cow skin, smoked turkey, or any other choice combination.</li>
        <li>1½ pounds of dried fish</li>
        <li>¼ chopped onion</li>
        <li>2-4 cups of palm oil</li>
        <li>½ cup of ground crayfish</li>
        <li>5-6 cups of dried chopped ukazi</li>
        <li>2 pounds of frozen spinach</li>
        <li>2 Maggi or bouillon powder cubes</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into small pieces and season with salt, Maggi, and onions, and cook until tender.<br> 
            Do the same for the cow skin, which requires a longer cooking time due to its toughness. <br> 
            Use minimal water while cooking the meat, as eru doesn't need much moisture. However, ensure <br>
            you have at least 2-3 cups of beef stock for the dish.</li>
        <li>While the meat cooks, soak the dried okazi (ero) leaves in hot water for 10-15 minutes to <br>
            soften them. Afterward, rinse and drain the leaves.</li>
        <li>In a large stock pot, combine the assorted meats—beef, cow skin, tripe, and dried fish or <br>
            turkey—with at least 2 cups of stock. Bring the mixture to a boil and let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, drain the thawed spinach and add it to the pot with the assorted meats and fish. <br>
            Incorporate crayfish and two tablespoons of bouillon or Maggi. Stir and cook over medium heat <br>
            for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded okazi (ero) leaves and red oil. Mix everything thoroughly to ensure all 
            ingredients<br> are well combined. Let it simmer for another 10 minutes, adding stock or water if<br> necessary.  
            The delightful aroma will signal that it's time to serve.</li>
        <li>Adjust the seasoning with salt( but be cautious with it as ero doesn't appreciate too much salt) <br>
            and additional Maggi to taste, as I typically season my dishes progressively.</li>
    </ol>
